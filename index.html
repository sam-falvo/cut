    C Unit Tester 2.6<br />
    Celebrating its Tenth Anniversary: 1998 - 2008!
   </h1>
   <h2>
    What is CUT?
   </h2>
   <p>
    CUT is designed to aid the C(-like) programmer in implementing unit
    or programmer tests, primarily to facilitate test-driven (and related)
    development practices.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Synopsis
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Generating the Test Runner
   </h3>
   <div id="Example">
    <tt>cutgen [options] [file1 [file2 [...]]]</tt>
   </div>
   <p>
    <tt>cutgen</tt> looks through the set of source files file1..filen, seeking
    idiomatic function definitions to discover unit test functions, bring-up
    functions, set-up functions, and their associated take-down functions.
    With this information, <tt>cutgen</tt> builds a <i>test runner</i>, which
    when compiled will invoke the unit tests specified in the input files.
   </p>
   <p>
    The <tt>-o/--output</tt> option, if specified, causes the test runner to be
    written to named file.  Without this option, <tt>cutgen</tt> defaults to
    writing the test runner to stdout.
   </p>
   <p>
    The <tt>--license</tt>, <tt>-h/--help</tt>, and <tt>--version</tt> options
    results in the display of the relavent information; no further action is
    taken, regardless of the presence of other options.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Using the Test Runner
   </h3>
   <p>
    Once the test runner has been compiled, it may be invoked without any
    parameters.  This will result in the unit tests being executed, typically
    in the order they were found by <tt>cutgen</tt>.  If all unit tests
    executed correctly, then <i>no</i> output is generated.
   </p>
   <p>
    To see a log of the assertions executed, pass the <tt>--verbose</tt> flag.
    The long flag is required; no short flag equivalent exists.
   </p>
   <p>
    You'll notice each assertion has a unique integer associated with it.
    Sometimes, stopping the unit test execution at a specific assertion has
    proven useful.  Use the <tt>--break-at</tt> long option to indicate which
    assertion to "break" at.  Use <tt>--verbose</tt> to find the number of the
    assertion you'd like to stop at.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Diagnostic Messages
   </h3>
   <p>
    Previous versions of CUT utilized a system of printing a dot for each
    assertion it executed.  This significantly complexified CUT's output of
    diagnostics, while concurrently rendering integration into IDEs and similar
    tools effectively impossible.  Starting with version 2.6, CUT no longer
    renders any output at all, unless a diagnostic message demands it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Diagnostic messages follow a prescribed format:
   </p>
   <div id="Example">
    <i>filename</i>:<i>line-number</i>:<i>assertion expression</i>:<i>kind</i>:<i>user-supplied diagnostic</i>
   </div>
   <p>
    The filename and line number indicates the source file, and the line within
    said file, containing the assertion.
   </p>
   <p>
    The assertion expression represents the assertion's boolean expression.
    This field exists as a convenience for the programmer, preventing the
    programmer from having to edit the unit test source to find out what went
    wrong in about 50% of the cases.
   </p>
   <p>
    The kind of diagnostic follows; it will be one of three possibilities:
    <tt>log</tt> (for <tt>--verbose</tt> output), <tt>break</tt> for a
    breakpoint hit, or <tt>error</tt> for a unit test failure.  Strictly
    speaking, this field exists for the benefit of some versions of
    <tt>make</tt>, which colorize their outputs depending on the presence of
    certain keywords, <tt>error</tt> usually resulting in a distinctively
    highlighted line.  This helps to track bugs down when pouring through
    voluminous amounts of recursive make output.
   </p>
   <p>
    Each assertion bundles with it a programmer-defined message which is output
    as the final field.  Considering the wealth of information present in other
    fields, however, good practice frowns on using this facility unless
    positively necessary.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Who Contributed to CUT?
   </h2>
   <p>
    CUT was primarily written by myself and by Billy Tanksley, starting
    life as distinct, and even competing, <tt>CUT 1.0</tt> and <tt>test-assert</tt>
    packages, respectively. When it was finally decided to combine both
    packages into a single tool, CUT 2.0 was released, and found to be
    vastly more useful than either of us ever expected.
   </p>
   <p>
    In 2004, Sergei Gnezdov <a
    href="../repo/stable/docs/tutorials/sergei_gnezdov/Tutorial.pdf">
    wrote a tutorial</a> based on CUT 2.3, which is still applicable
    to the CUT 2.4 version.  You will need Adobe Acrobat reader to read
    the file, as it was written in LaTeX.  The tutorial and its source
    files are also included in the source distribution.  Sergei also
    contributed CUT to the BSD ports collection!
   </p>
   <h2>
    What is Different About CUT 2.6 Versus 2.4?
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     History repeats itself: As with CUT versions 2.0 through 2.2, cutgen 2.6
     has been rewritten back into Python.  Too many potential users of CUT were
     turned off by my choice of Haskell for the 3.0 research and development
     edition.
    </li>
    <li>
     CUT 2.6 includes proper <b>setup</b> support now, so that you can write
     more "normal" unit tests.  Setups and Bringups can be mutually
     nested to any reasonable depth, and interact in the expected ways.
    </li>
    <li>
     No more <tt>ASSERT_EQUALS</tt>, <tt>__cut_interject()</tt>, or other
     functions that date back to 1998's TestAssert implementation.  As
     indicated in the documentation for CUT 2.1, these things were all
     deprecated in favor of just using ASSERT().  2.6 seemed like a good
     time to finally lose the baggage.
    </li>
    <li>
     I found myself using phrases like <tt>ASSERT(..., "");</tt> in my code a
     lot.  So, I introduced the <tt>ASSERT_()</tt> macro which is a
     single-parameter assertion with an empty description.
    </li>
    <li>
     "Breakpoint" functionality is still supported.  The method of use has
     changed, however.  You must now use the <tt>--break-at</tt> command-line
     option to your test runner (e.g., <tt>cut-check --break-at 145</tt>).  Use
     the <tt>--verbose</tt> option to display the running count of assertions
     so far.
    </li>
    <li>
     The output format has changed drastically, making it easier for
     integration with other development tools.
    </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>
    Installing CUT
   </h2>
   <p>
    Once acquired, simply execute the following (you'll need GNU Make
    version 3.80 or later for the non-recursive make system to work):
   </p>
   <div id="Example">
    <tt>
     make install PREFIX=/usr/local
    </tt>
   </div>
   <p>
    Make sure to update your path settings as appropriate.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you, like me, <a href="http://www.gobolinux.org">use GoboLinux</a>, you can execute the following:
   </p>
   <div id="Example">
    <tt>
     make install PREFIX=/Programs/CUT/2.6<br />
     SymlinkProgram Cut 2.6
