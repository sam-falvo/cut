    CUT 3.0 -- C Unit Tester 3.0
   </h1>
   <h2>
    What is CUT?
   </h2>
   <p>
    CUT is designed to aid the C (or C-derived, statically compiled
    language) programmer in implementing unit or programmer tests,
    primarily to facilitate test-driven (and related) development
    practices.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Who Contributed to CUT?
   </h2>
   <p>
    CUT was primarily written by myself and by Billy Tanksley, starting
    life as distinct, and even competing, CUT 1.0 and test-assert
    packages, respectively. When it was finally decided to combine both
    packages into a single tool, CUT 2.0 was released, and found to be
    vastly more useful than either expected.
   </p>
   <p>
    In 2004, Sergei Gnezdov <a
    href="../repo/stable/docs/tutorials/sergei_gnezdov/Tutorial.pdf">
    wrote a tutorial</a> based on CUT 2.3, which is still applicable
    to the CUT 2.4 version.  You will need Adobe Acrobat reader to read
    the file, as it was written in LaTeX.  The tutorial and its source
    files are also included in the source distribution.  Sergei also
    contributed CUT to the BSD ports collection!
   </p>
   <h2>
    What is Different About CUT 3 Versus 2.4?
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     CUT 3 has been rewritten in Haskell.  Originally intended as a
     quick-n-dirty port of 2.4 to learn the language, it was quickly
     realized that the quality of the code was substantially improved
     over its previous C implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
     CUT 3 includes proper "setup" support now, so that you can write
     more "normal" unit tests.  Setups and Bringups can be mutually
     nested to any reasonable depth, and interact in the expected ways.
    </li>
    <li>
     No more <tt>ASSERT_EQUALS</tt>, <tt>__cut_interject()</tt>, or other
     functions that date back to 1998's TestAssert implementation.  As
     indicated in the documentation for CUT 2.1, these things were all
     deprecated in favor of just using ASSERT().  3.0 seemed like a good
     time to finally lose the baggage.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Getting CUT
   </h2>
   <p>
    CUT 3.0 is still being developed, and therefore has no binaries
    available for download.  However, if you use the <a
    href="http://www.darcs.net">Darcs</a> source management tool, you may
    acquire the latest development snapshot, which includes these
    webpages as well.  Contributors to the code are encouraged to update
    corresponding web pages as well, to ensure the online documentation
    matches the latest CUT developments.
   </p>

   <h2>
    Installing CUT
   </h2>
   <p>
    Once acquired, simply execute the following (you'll need GNU Make
    version 3.80 or later for the non-recursive make system to work):
   </p>
   <div id="Example">
    <tt>
     make all<br/>
     PREFIX=/usr/local make install
    </tt>
   </div>
   <p>
    If you, like me, are a GoboLinux user, you can execute the following:
   </p>
   <div id="Example">
    <tt>
     make all<br/>
     PREFIX=/Programs/Cut/3.0pre1 make install<br/>
     SymlinkProgram Cut 3.0pre1
    </tt>
   </div>
   <p>
    That should build and install the cutgen utility.  Other components will be
    documented and automated as time permits.
