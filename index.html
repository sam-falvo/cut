    C Unit Tester 3.0<br />
    1998 - 2008!

   <h2>
    What is CUT?
   </h2>
   <p>
    CUT is designed to aid the C(-like) programmer in implementing unit
    or programmer tests, primarily to facilitate test-driven (and related)
    development practices.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Who Contributed to CUT?
   </h2>
   <p>
    CUT was primarily written by myself and by Billy Tanksley, starting
    life as distinct, and even competing, <tt>CUT 1.0</tt> and <tt>test-assert</tt>
    packages, respectively. When it was finally decided to combine both
    packages into a single tool, CUT 2.0 was released, and found to be
    vastly more useful than either of us ever expected.
   </p>
   <p>
    In 2004, Sergei Gnezdov <a
    href="../repo/stable/docs/tutorials/sergei_gnezdov/Tutorial.pdf">
    wrote a tutorial</a> based on CUT 2.3, which is still applicable
    to the CUT 2.4 version.  You will need Adobe Acrobat reader to read
    the file, as it was written in LaTeX.  The tutorial and its source
    files are also included in the source distribution.  Sergei also
    contributed CUT to the BSD ports collection!
   </p>
   <h2>
    What is Different About CUT 2.6 Versus 2.4?
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     History repeats itself: As with CUT versions 2.0 through 2.2, cutgen 2.6
     has been rewritten back into Python.  Too many potential users of CUT were
     turned off by my choice of Haskell for the 3.0 research and development
     edition.
    </li>
    <li>
     CUT 2.6 includes proper <b>setup</b> support now, so that you can write
     more "normal" unit tests.  Setups and Bringups can be mutually
     nested to any reasonable depth, and interact in the expected ways.
    </li>
    <li>
     No more <tt>ASSERT_EQUALS</tt>, <tt>__cut_interject()</tt>, or other
     functions that date back to 1998's TestAssert implementation.  As
     indicated in the documentation for CUT 2.1, these things were all
     deprecated in favor of just using ASSERT().  2.6 seemed like a good
     time to finally lose the baggage.
    </li>
    <li>
     I found myself using phrases like <tt>ASSERT(..., "");</tt> in my code a
     lot.  So, I introduced the <tt>ASSERT_()</tt> macro which is a
     single-parameter assertion with an empty description.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Getting CUT
   </h2>
   <p>
    CUT 2.6 is officially released.  However, no binaries exist at this time.
    The <a href="http://www.selenic.com">Mercurial</a> repository exists at the
    URL below.  Contributors to the code are encouraged to update corresponding
    web pages as well, to ensure the online documentation matches the latest
    CUT developments.

    <tt>
     hg clone http://www.falvotech.com/content/cut

   <h2>
    Installing CUT
   </h2>
   <p>
    Once acquired, simply execute the following (you'll need GNU Make
    version 3.80 or later for the non-recursive make system to work):
   </p>
   <div id="Example">
    <tt>
     make all<br/>
     make install PREFIX=/usr/local
    </tt>
   </div>
   <p>
    Make sure to update your path settings as appropriate.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you, like me, <a href="http://www.gobolinux.org">use GoboLinux</a>, you can execute the following:
   </p>
   <div id="Example">
    <tt>
     make all<br />
     make install PREFIX=/Programs/CUT/2.6<br />
     SymlinkProgram Cut 2.6
